To Develop with Eclipse:
1. Fork RecipeManager2: https://github.com/haveric/RecipeManager2
2. Setup Eclipse and install the latest java jre and jdk
3. Install "Gradle Integration for Eclipse" from the Eclipse Marketplace

Eclipse setup:
1. Copy the clone url from your forked recipeManager2. Should look similar to this: https://github.com/UserOrTeamName/recipeManager2.git
2. Open/Select File->Import->Git->Projects from Git and then click Next
3. Select Clone URI and then click Next
4. The Location information should autofill if you copied the url from step 1
4a. The URI should match step 1
4b. Host should be github.com
4c. Repository path should be similar to UserOrTeamName/recipeManager2.git
5. (Optional) Fill out Authentication information so you don't have to every time you commit (and select Store in Secure Store)
6. Click Next
7. On the Branch Selection screen, the master branch should already be selected. Click Next

9. Leave the imort as "Import existing Eclipse projects" and click Next
10. recipeManager2 should be selected and you can hit finish
11. In the branch selection of RecipeManager2, there is a master branch and a gh-pages branch. You only need the master branch for development. gh-pages is for website testing which I may be moving in the future
12. Continue to import the existing project.
13. You should now have one project in eclipse: RecipeManager2

To Build RecipeManager:
1. Right click RecipeManager2 and select Gradle->Tasks Quick Launcher
2. Enter "clean build" and make sure the project selected is RecipeManager2 before hitting enter
3. The jar should get created in build/libs/
